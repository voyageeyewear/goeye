## 🐛 Critical Bug Fix: Emulator DNS Issue

### Problem
Android emulator was unable to resolve the Railway domain (`motivated-intuition-production.up.railway.app`), causing "Error Loading Store" messages.

### Root Cause
- Android emulator DNS cache issues
- Default emulator DNS not resolving Railway subdomain

### Solution
Restart emulator with Google DNS servers:

```bash
# Kill current emulator
adb emu kill

# Start with Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)
/Users/ssenterprises/Library/Android/sdk/emulator/emulator \
  -avd Medium_Phone_API_36.0 \
  -dns-server 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 \
  -no-snapshot &

# Wait for boot
adb wait-for-device

# Install and launch
adb install -r Goeye-v12.6.1-Build129-FITS-IN-CARD.apk
adb shell am start -n com.goeye.app/.MainActivity
```

### Alternative DNS Fix
```bash
adb root
adb shell setprop net.dns1 8.8.8.8
adb shell setprop net.dns2 8.8.4.4
```

---

## ✅ Verification

### Backend Status
Railway backend is **LIVE and OPERATIONAL**:
```bash
curl https://motivated-intuition-production.up.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Shopify Middleware API is running",
  "store": "goeyee.myshopify.com",
  "database": "Connected"
}
```

### DNS Resolution Test
```bash
# From your Mac
ping -c 2 motivated-intuition-production.up.railway.app

# From emulator (after DNS fix)
adb shell ping -c 2 motivated-intuition-production.up.railway.app
```

Both should resolve to IP: `66.33.22.215`

## 📦 Installation

### Fresh Install

# Start emulator with DNS fix

  -avd Medium_Phone_API_36.0 \
  -dns-server 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 \
  -no-snapshot > /tmp/emulator.log 2>&1 &

# Wait for boot (takes ~30 seconds)
sleep 30
