## ⚠️ VIDEO SLIDER ISSUE - Needs Backend Fix

### The Problem:
Your hero slider is showing **images** instead of **videos** because the Shopify backend is returning all slides as `"type":"image"`.

###Current Backend Data:
```json
{
  "type": "image",  // ❌ Should be "video" for MP4 files
  "desktopImage": "https://eyejack.in/cdn/shop/files/...",
  "mobileImage": "https://eyejack.in/cdn/shop/files/..."
}
```

### What It Should Be for Videos:
```json
{
  "type": "video",  // ✅ For MP4 files
  "videoUrl": "https://eyejack.in/cdn/shop/files/your-video.mp4",
  "posterImage": "https://eyejack.in/cdn/shop/files/thumbnail.jpg"
}
```

### How to Fix:
You need to update the Shopify theme settings to configure video slides:

1. **Go to Shopify Admin**
2. **Navigate to**: Online Store → Themes → Customize
3. **Find**: Hero Slider section
4. **For each slide** you want as video:
   - Change type from "Image" to "Video"
   - Upload/add your MP4 URL
   - Add a poster/thumbnail image

**The app code is already ready for videos!** Once you update Shopify, videos will auto-play with full height and no cropping.
