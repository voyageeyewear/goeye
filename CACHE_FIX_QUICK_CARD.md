## 🚨 Nuclear Option (If Nothing Works):

```bash

cd goeye_flutter_app
flutter clean
rm -rf build/ android/.gradle/ android/app/build/
rm -rf ~/.gradle
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
cd ..
adb uninstall com.goeye.shopify_app
adb install goeye_flutter_app/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
adb shell pm clear com.goeye.shopify_app
