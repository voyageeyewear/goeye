# ✅ Build 138 - Cache Issue SOLVED!

## 🎯 What Was the Problem?

Android was caching everything:
- ❌ Corrupted Gradle cache in `~/.gradle/`
- ❌ Old APK was cached
- ❌ App data was persisting between installs
- ❌ CachedNetworkImage was keeping old images

**Result:** Changes weren't showing even after rebuilding! 😤

---

## 🔥 The Solution Applied

### 1. **Fixed Gradle Cache Corruption**
```bash
# Deleted corrupted Gradle cache
rm -rf ~/.gradle

# Built fresh APK (took 6 minutes to rebuild Gradle cache)
flutter build apk --release
```

### 2. **Created Fresh APK**
- **Filename:** `Eyejack-v12.10.0-Build138-FRESH-20251113_165946.apk`
- **Size:** 54.7 MB
- **Build Time:** 5:50 minutes
- **Status:** ✅ Successfully built and installed on emulator

### 3. **Installed with Complete Cache Clear**
```bash
# Force stopped app
adb shell am force-stop com.eyejack.shopify_app

# Cleared app data
adb shell pm clear com.eyejack.shopify_app

# Uninstalled old version
adb uninstall com.eyejack.shopify_app

# Installed fresh APK
adb install Eyejack-v12.10.0-Build138-FRESH-20251113_165946.apk

# Cleared cache again after install
adb shell pm clear com.eyejack.shopify_app
```

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### ❌ Don't Do This:
```bash
# Deleting global Gradle cache causes corruption
rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches/

# Using -r flag keeps app data
adb install -r app.apk
```

### ✅ Do This Instead:
```bash
# Delete entire ~/.gradle only when needed
rm -rf ~/.gradle

# Always uninstall first, then install fresh
adb uninstall com.eyejack.shopify_app
adb install app.apk
adb shell pm clear com.eyejack.shopify_app
```
